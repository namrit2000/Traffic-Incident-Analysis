# Traffic Incident Analysis

This project analyzes traffic incidents reported in the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) to identify crash patterns, high-risk areas, and contributing factors such as demographics, time, location, and road conditions.

## Objectives
- Uncover crash patterns by time, location, and driver demographics
- Identify severity-related factors (e.g., weather, road conditions, substance use)
- Develop predictive models for incident severity
- Create spatial heatmaps for crash hotspots

## Dataset
- Source: Cary Police Department via NIBRS
- Range: Last 5 years (ongoing updates)
- Key Features: Incident type, driver age/gender, alcohol/drug use, weather, road conditions

## Tools & Techniques
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- EDA & Visualizations: Correlation heatmaps, bar plots, pie charts
- Geospatial: Latitude/Longitude plotting, incident mapping
- Predictive: Future models with classification/regression

## Future Scope
- Real-time incident tracking
- Behavioral and temporal modeling
- Advanced geospatial clustering
- Community engagement strategies
